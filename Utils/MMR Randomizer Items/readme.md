# MMR Randomizer Items

The purpose of this utility is to generate a json formatted list of all the items/checks in a format we want. These files should mirror the main randomiser application.

Based on [Majora's Mask Randomiser Repo v1.14.0.16](https://github.com/ZoeyZolotova/mm-rando/releases/tag/v1.14.0.16)
